# HashTable
Tabla hash para la indizalizaci√≥n y serializacion del contenido de un archivo binario. \n \n

I've finished the hash table with lots of changes. \n
*I remove the dynamic list and started working with class arrays instead. \n
*I create a new file called "collisions.bin" where all collisions will be saved. (I was so tired of this project) \n
*Now you can delete and deal with collisions \n
*I added some colors to make the project look cooler. \n
*A new drawing for the delete algorithm \n
