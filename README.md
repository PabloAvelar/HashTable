# HashTable
Tabla hash para la indizalizaci√≥n y serializacion del contenido de un archivo binario.

I've finished the hash table with lots of changes.

*I remove the dynamic list and started working with class arrays instead. 

*I create a new file called "collisions.bin" where all collisions will be saved. (I was so tired of this project) 

*Now you can delete and deal with collisions 

*I added some colors to make the project look cooler. 

*A new drawing for the delete algorithm
